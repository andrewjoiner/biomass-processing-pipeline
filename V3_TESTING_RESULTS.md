## Expected V3 Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Crop Analysis
**V1 Limitation**: Only dominant crop per parcel saved  
**V3 Enhancement**: All detected crops with area percentages

**Expected Results**:
```sql
-- Example McLean County parcel with multiple crops
parcel_id: "IL_17113_001234"
crops: [
  {crop_name: "Corn", area_percentage: 65.2, yield_tons: 12.4},
  {crop_name: "Soybeans", area_percentage: 32.8, yield_tons: 3.1},
  {crop_name: "Winter Wheat", area_percentage: 2.0, yield_tons: 0.3}
]
```

### 2. Enhanced Forestry Analysis  
**V1 Limitation**: Basic biomass total only  
**V3 Enhancement**: Full species breakdown and biomass components

**Expected Results**:
```sql
-- Example forestry parcel with enhanced data
parcel_id: "IL_17113_567890"
forestry: {
  dominant_species: "Eastern Cottonwood",
  species_diversity_index: 2.3,
  bole_biomass_tons: 45.2,
  branch_biomass_tons: 12.8,
  foliage_biomass_tons: 3.4,
  harvest_probability: 0.73
}
```

### 3. Real-Time Data Quality
**V1 Limitation**: Placeholder NDVI values, hardcoded confidence  
**V3 Enhancement**: Real Sentinel-2 NDVI, dynamic confidence scoring

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risk ✅
- **Infrastructure**: All V3 components validated and working
- **Database**: Schema created, connections confirmed
- **Test Data**: McLean County provides ideal validation scenario

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Performance**: V3 processing may be slower than V1 due to enhanced data writes
- **Data Volume**: Multiple crop records will increase database storage requirements

### Mitigation Strategies 🛡️
- **Performance**: Optimized batch sizes (25-50 parcels) for enhanced processing
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and timing analysis in test scripts
- **Fallback**: V1 remains operational if V3 performance issues discovered
