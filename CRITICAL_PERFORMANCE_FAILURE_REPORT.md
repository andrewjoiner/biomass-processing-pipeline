# CRITICAL PERFORMANCE FAILURE REPORT
## McLean County Processing Test - August 11, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FAILURE**: McLean County processing test failed catastrophically, running for **3+ hours** while processing less than 1% of parcels. Target was <1 hour for complete county processing.

**Root Cause**: Streaming architecture is NOT functioning - system falls back to downloading full 250MB tiles instead of streaming pixel windows, resulting in 100x+ performance degradation.

---

## Test Configuration

- **County**: McLean County, Illinois (FIPS: 17-113)
- **Total Parcels**: 66,907
- **Target Performance**: <1 hour (ideally <30 minutes)
- **Batch Size**: 500 parcels
- **Architecture**: V3 Streaming Pipeline

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. ❌ Streaming Architecture Failure
```
2025-08-11 16:35:56,976 - 📦 Falling back to full tile download and caching for sentinel2_august/15TTE_20240831_B02.tif
```
- **Expected**: Stream 1-2MB pixel windows per parcel
- **Actual**: Downloading full 250MB tiles in 4MB chunks
- **Impact**: 100x+ more data transfer than designed

### 2. ❌ Performance Degradation
- **Parcels Processed**: ~500 of 66,907 (0.75%)
- **Time Elapsed**: 3+ hours
- **Projected County Completion**: **267+ hours (11+ days)**
- **Target**: <1 hour
- **Performance Gap**: **267x slower than required**

### 3. ❌ Database Connection Failures
```
2025-08-11 16:34:59,499 - Database connection failed on forestry, attempt 1/4, retrying in 1s: 
server closed the connection unexpectedly
```
- Forestry database dropping connections under load
- Connection pool exhaustion likely
- Error recovery adding additional delays

### 4. ❌ Chunked Download Pattern
Multiple 4MB requests per tile instead of single streaming request:
```
Request headers:
    'x-ms-range': 'REDACTED'
    'Content-Length': '4194304'  # 4MB chunks
```
Seeing 15-20 sequential 4MB downloads per tile = full tile download

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Failure: Pixel Streaming Not Enabled

1. **GeoTIFF Header Parsing**: Returns `streaming_supported: False`
   - Line 1102 in blob_manager_v3.py hardcoded to False
   - Even with header parsing implemented, not enabling streaming

2. **Pixel Window Calculation**: Working but not used
   - Calculates 1113x1116 pixel windows correctly
   - But falls back to full download due to streaming_supported flag

3. **Fallback Logic Always Triggered**:
```python
if header_info and header_info.get('streaming_supported'):  # Always False
    # Streaming code never reached
else:
    # Always falls back to full tile download
    logger.info(f"📦 Falling back to full tile download and caching for {blob_path}")
```

### Secondary Issues

1. **Tile Cache Ineffective**: 
   - 144 tiles × 250MB = 36GB memory required
   - Cache eviction thrashing with 50 tile limit
   - Each parcel potentially downloading same tiles repeatedly

2. **No Parallel Processing**:
   - Sequential parcel processing
   - No concurrent tile downloads
   - No batch optimization

3. **Network Overhead**:
   - Each tile download split into dozens of HTTP requests
   - Round-trip latency multiplied by chunk count
   - No HTTP/2 or connection pooling optimization

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Gap |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Total Runtime | <60 minutes | 204+ minutes (incomplete) | 3.4x+ over |
| Parcels/Hour | 66,907 | ~147 | 455x slower |
| Data Transfer per Parcel | ~2MB | ~250MB | 125x more |
| Streaming Pixel Windows | 100% | 0% | Complete failure |
| Cache Hit Rate | >90% | Unknown (likely <10%) | Failed |

---

## Required Fixes

### Immediate (P0)
1. **Enable Streaming**: Set `streaming_supported = True` when conditions met
2. **Fix Pixel Streaming**: Complete implementation of range request streaming
3. **Reduce Batch Size**: Process 50-100 parcels per batch to reduce memory pressure

### Short-term (P1)
1. **Implement Parallel Processing**: Process multiple parcels concurrently
2. **Optimize Cache**: Increase cache size or implement better eviction
3. **Add Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for tile downloads

### Long-term (P2)
1. **Pre-index Tiles**: Build tile index once, reuse for all parcels
2. **Implement COG Optimization**: Use Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF features
3. **Add Progress Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and abort conditions

---

## Test Environment

- **Machine**: macOS 15.5 ARM64
- **Python**: 3.9.12
- **Memory**: Unknown (likely insufficient for 36GB tile cache)
- **Network**: Residential broadband
- **Azure Region**: Unknown (latency impact possible)

---

## Recommendations

### 1. DO NOT run full county tests until streaming is verified working
### 2. Test with 5-10 parcels first, verify <1MB downloads per parcel
### 3. Add monitoring to detect and abort if falling back to full downloads
### 4. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Pre-download and cache all tiles (36GB)
   - Use Azure VM in same region as storage
   - Implement true COG range requests
   - Switch to different data source with better streaming support

---

## Conclusion

The V3 streaming architecture has **completely failed** to meet performance requirements. The system is downloading full tiles instead of streaming pixel windows, resulting in 100x+ performance degradation. 

**Current implementation would require 11+ days to process a single county that should complete in <1 hour.**

This is a **CRITICAL BLOCKER** for production deployment.
